Assignment #3

IPython 
1.	Locate the file that the os.path.abspath function is defined in. Hint: Look for some way to find out more information about a Python object, and find one that tells you about the file that the function is defined in. What is the command you used and the path of the file?  
os.path.abspath?
Type:       function
String Form:<function abspath at 0x7ff3f01539b0>
File:       /usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py
Definition: os.path.abspath(path)
Docstring:  Return an absolute path.


2.	Use a single shell command to count the number of files in the /etc directory. Once you have the shell command, look at the IPython documentation for a way to run a shell command and assign the result to a variable called “num”. What is the command you used to assign the value to num? 
%cd /etc
%pwd
from IPython.utils.text import SList
num = !ls -l
num = int(num.fields(1).s[0:4])

 
3.	Print the square root of num. What command did you use, and what is the value?  
num**2
1373584


4.	Set a variable x = 12345. Calculate the square of x using the following methods: x**2, x*x, or numpy.square(x). Which is the fastest method? Hint: the %timeit line magic will show how long it takes to execute a statement. Also, you must import the numpy library before trying to use any numpy functions.  
x*x is the fastest

%timeit x**2
10000000 loops, best of 3: 69.8 ns per loop

%timeit x*x
10000000 loops, best of 3: 61.3 ns per loop

import numpy
%timeit numpy.square(x)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.48 µs per loop


5.	How many cell magic commands are there?  
%lsmagic
24
